The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between actual house prices and house prices predicted by the Linear Regression model.
The data points are scattered around the ideal line, indicating that the model is not perfect but still fits well.
The predicted values are often higher than the actual values, suggesting that the model tends to overestimate house prices.
