This is a scatter plot of actual values versus predicted values using the Ridge model.
The chart illustrates a positive correlation between actual values and predicted values, with the majority of data points falling close to the ideal straight line.
This indicates that the model performs well in predicting house prices.
However, there are some exceptions that fall far from the ideal straight line, indicating that the model may not be able to accurately predict all house prices.
