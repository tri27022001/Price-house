Some data points lie close to the Ideal Line, indicating accurate predictions. 
However, there are also cases where the predictions are significantly off.
The density of the data points is higher at lower values and becomes sparse at higher values. This may indicate that your model has a higher complexity when dealing with lower-valued cases, and a lower complexity when dealing with higher-valued cases.
